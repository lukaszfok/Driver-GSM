Main goal in this project is write a good driver "state machine" for GSM modul.

At this moment driver can open port and correct comunicate with modul GSM by "At" comand,
state machine can check the comunication and verifie response from modul GSM
next step ask for SIM state and will go to next state if your SIM have PIN and ask you for your PIN
or if your SIM have PUK response ask you for your PUK. I future time i want to add a funcionality to change PIN on SIM 
card and possibility SMS send and Call.
